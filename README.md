# Model-based discretisation for logistic regression

Here are the programs needed to run the model proposed in the following poster presented at the Data Science Summer School.

discretize_sem.py contains the function producing the discretization.
discretize_link.py contains the function using the result of discretize_sem.py to discretize a test set.
example.py runs an example discretization based on simulation data.
poster_simulation_data_mode.py reproduces the results of Table 1.b. on the poster.

Other results are not presented here due to confidentiality issues.
